# Serverless Data Analysis with Big Query - Lab 1

## 1. Create and run a query

1. In the **Query window** run the following query:

    ```sql
        SELECT
            airline,
            date,
            departure_delay
        FROM
            `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
        WHERE
            departure_delay > 0
        AND departure_airport = 'LGA'
        LIMIT
            100
    ```

2. **Run** the query

## 2. Aggregate and Boolean functions

Run the following:

```sql
SELECT
  airline,
  COUNT(departure_delay)
FROM
   `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
WHERE
  departure_airport = 'LGA'
  AND date = '2008-05-13'
GROUP BY
  airline
ORDER BY airline
```

Now run this modified version of the same query. This on the other hand shows the number of delayed flights from `LGA`

```sql
SELECT
  airline,
  COUNT(departure_delay)
FROM
   `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
WHERE
  departure_delay > 0 AND
  departure_airport = 'LGA'
  AND date = '2008-05-13'
GROUP BY
  airline
ORDER BY airline
```

Can you write a query to get both the number of flights delayed and the total number of flights in a single query?

```sql
SELECT
  f.airline,
  COUNT(f.departure_delay) AS total_flights,
  SUM(IF(f.departure_delay > 0, 1, 0)) AS num_delayed
FROM
   `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights` AS f
WHERE
  f.departure_airport = 'LGA' AND f.date = '2008-05-13'
GROUP BY
  f.airline
```

## String Operations

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(CAST(year AS STRING), '-', LPAD(CAST(month AS STRING),2,'0'), '-', LPAD(CAST(day AS STRING),2,'0')) AS rainyday
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.weather_geo.gsod`
WHERE
  station_number = 725030
  AND total_precipitation > 0
```

How would you do the airline query to aggregate over all these dates instead of just â€˜2008-05-13'?

## Join on Date

```sql
SELECT
  f.airline,
  SUM(IF(f.arrival_delay > 0, 1, 0)) AS num_delayed,
  COUNT(f.arrival_delay) AS total_flights
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights` AS f
JOIN (
  SELECT
    CONCAT(CAST(year AS STRING), '-', LPAD(CAST(month AS STRING),2,'0'), '-', LPAD(CAST(day AS STRING),2,'0')) AS rainyday
  FROM
    `bigquery-samples.weather_geo.gsod`
  WHERE
    station_number = 725030
    AND total_precipitation > 0) AS w
ON
  w.rainyday = f.date
WHERE f.arrival_airport = 'LGA'
GROUP BY f.airline
```


## Subqueries

How would you get the fraction of flights delayed for each airline? You could put the entire query above into a subquery and then select from the columns of this result.

```sql
SELECT
  airline,
  num_delayed,
  total_flights,
  num_delayed / total_flights AS frac_delayed
FROM (
SELECT
  f.airline AS airline,
  SUM(IF(f.arrival_delay > 0, 1, 0)) AS num_delayed,
  COUNT(f.arrival_delay) AS total_flights
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights` AS f
JOIN (
  SELECT
    CONCAT(CAST(year AS STRING), '-', LPAD(CAST(month AS STRING),2,'0'), '-', LPAD(CAST(day AS STRING),2,'0')) AS rainyday
  FROM
    `bigquery-samples.weather_geo.gsod`
  WHERE
    station_number = 725030
    AND total_precipitation > 0) AS w
ON
  w.rainyday = f.date
WHERE f.arrival_airport = 'LGA'
GROUP BY f.airline
  )
ORDER BY
  frac_delayed ASC
```
