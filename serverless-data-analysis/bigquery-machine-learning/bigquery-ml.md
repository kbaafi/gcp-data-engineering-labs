# Exploring ecommerce data with Bigquery

## Access the datasource

Once BigQuery is open, open on the below direct link in a new browser tab to bring the public data-to-insights project into your BigQuery projects panel:

* https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=data-to-insights&d=ecommerce&t=web_analytics&page=table

The field definitions for the **data-to-insights** dataset can be found at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en. Keep the link open in a new tab

## Explore the dataset

Your data analyst team exported the Google Analytics logs for an ecommerce website into BigQuery and created a new table of all the raw ecommerce visitor session data for you to explore. Using this data, you'll try to answer a few questions.

**Question**: Out of the total visitors to the site, what percentage made a purchase?

```sql
#standardSQL
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),

purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers
```

**Question**: What are the top 5 selling products?

```sql
SELECT
  p.v2ProductName,
  p.v2ProductCategory,
  SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(h.product) AS p
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Question**: How many visitors bought on subsequent visits to the website?

```sql
# visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
```

## Identifying an objective

Now you will create a Machine Learning model in BigQuery to predict whether or not a new user is likely to purchase in the future. Identifying these high-value users can help your marketing team target them with special promotions and ad campaigns to ensure a conversion while they comparison shop between visits to your ecommerce site.

## Selecting features

Google Analytics captures a wide variety of dimensions and measures about a user's visit on this ecommerce website. Browse the complete list of fields here(https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en) and then preview the demo dataset(https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/data-to-insights:ecommerce.web_analytics?tab=preview) to find useful features that will help a machine learning model understand the relationship between data about a visitor's first time on your website and whether they will return and make a purchase.

Your team decides to test whether these two fields are good inputs for your classification model:


Machine learning is only as good as the training data that is fed into it. If there isn't enough information for the model to determine and learn the relationship between your input features and your label (in this case, whether the visitor bought in the future) then you will not have an accurate model. While training a model on just these two fields is a start, you will see if they're good enough to produce an accurate model.

In the query editor, add the following query

```sql 
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1)
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Discussion**: **will_buy_on_return_visit** is not known after the first visit. Again, you're predicting for a subset of users who returned to your website and purchased. Since you don't know the future at prediction time, you cannot say with certainty whether a new visitor come back and purchase. The value of building a ML model is to get the probability of future purchase based on the data gleaned about their first session.

**Question**: Looking at the initial data results, do you think **time_on_site** and **bounces** will be a good indicator of whether the user will return and purchase or not?

**Answer**: It's often too early to tell before training and evaluating the model, but at first glance out of the top 10 time_on_site, only 1 customer returned to buy, which isn't very promising. Let's see how well the model does.

## Create a BigQuery dataset to store models

Next, create a new BigQuery dataset which will also store your ML models.

1. In the left pane, click on your project name, and then click Create Dataset.

2. In the Create Dataset dialog:

    * For Dataset ID, type ecommerce.

    * Leave the other values at their defaults.

3. Click Create dataset

## Select a BQML Model type and specify options

![models](images/model_types.PNG)

Enter the following query to create a model and specify model options:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;
```

## Improve model performance with Feature Engineering

Add some new features and create a second machine learning model called classification_model_2:

* How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit

* Where the visitor came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc..)

* Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)

* Geographic information (country)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`
OPTIONS
  (model_type='logistic_reg', labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']) AS

WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,

      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,

      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,

      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430' # train 9 months

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
);
```

> **Note**: You are still training on the same first 9 months of data, even with this new model. It's important to have the same training dataset so you can be certain a better model output is attributable to better input features and not new or different training data.

A key new feature that was added to the training dataset query is the maximum checkout progress each visitor reached in their session, which is recorded in the field hits.eCommerceAction.action_type. If you search for that field in the field definitions you will see the field mapping of 6 = Completed Purchase.

As an aside, the web analytics dataset has nested and repeated fields like ARRAYS which need to broken apart into separate rows in your dataset. This is accomplished by using the UNNEST() function, which you can see in the above query.

Wait for the new model to finish training (5-10 minutes).

Evaluate this new model to see if there is better predictive power:
```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model_2,  (

WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,

      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,

      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,

      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630' # eval 2 months

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
)
));
```

## Predict which new visitors will come back for a purchase

Next you will write a query to predict which new visitors will come back and make a purchase.

The prediction query below uses the improved classification model to predict the probability that a first-time visitor to the Google Merchandise Store will make a purchase in a later visit:

```sql
SELECT
*
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`,
   (

WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, '-',CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,

      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,

      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,

      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE
    # only predict for new visits
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801' # test 1 month

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
)

)

ORDER BY
  predicted_will_buy_on_return_visit DESC;
```
